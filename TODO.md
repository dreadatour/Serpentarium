TODO
====

* python built-ins autocomplete
* do not rebuild all files with ctags - only rebuild changed file and merge it into list of tags
* try to autocomplete only with used modules (parse imports?)
* simple use without project setup (slower and less-usable, but much simpler)
* write big understandable readme with pictures and howto's - setup project, use features, etc
* what about python 3?
